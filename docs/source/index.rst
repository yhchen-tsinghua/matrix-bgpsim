matrix-bgpsim documentation
===========================

`matrix-bgpsim` is a Python project that provides a high-performance BGP routing simulator built on matrix operations. It enables full-scale AS-level route generation across the entire global Internet topology (77k+ ASes) in just a few hours, following the Gao-Rexford simulation model. It supports CPU backend with Python-native multiprocessing, and optionally GPU acceleration via PyTorch and CuPy backends.
